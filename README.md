# <Challenge 1>

## To refactor this code to be accessible and organized.

- My motivation for this project was twofold. The main priority was to refactor the code so that it was accessble. In doing so, I was able to produce code that was cleaner, increasing organization and making it more readable for fellow programmers.
- I built this product so that people with sight limitations would be able to easily use the website.
- The problem I've been able to solve was that the code as it was was unorganized and not set up for people who use screenreaders.
- I learned many things during this project. The most important thing I learned is that messy code is just that- messy. It was hard for me to decipher what was what at a glance. It provided a glimpse into how confusing it would be to interect with the code or website as somebody with vision limitations. The next thing I learned was how to correctly section DIVs.

## Usage

- The project is easy to use as it is a simple webpage that highlights how a particular company uses SEO practices to optimize web companies as well as the potential benefits of doing so. The page is not interactive; it is one readable page.
